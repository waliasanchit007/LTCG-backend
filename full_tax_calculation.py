    Processes scheme transactions (using FIFO and per-unit cost) and returns a detailed summary.
    
    Investment summary (over entire history) includes:
      - total_investment_made: sum of all purchase amounts.
      - current_market_value: computed as remaining_units * current NAV.
      - currently_invested: cost basis of remaining shares (sum over each remaining lot: purchase_nav * units).
      - withdrawn_amount: overall withdrawn (sum of all redemption cash inflows).
      - overall_profit: (withdrawn_amount + current_market_value) - total_investment_made.
      - profit_percentage: overall_profit / total_investment_made * 100.
      - xirr: annualized return from the entire cash-flow history.
      - cash_flows: a list of [date, amount] pairs used for XIRR calculation.
    
    Realized and unrealized tax liabilities are computed using only transactions in the current financial year 
    (FY defined here as April 1 â€“ March 31).
    
    For ELSS funds (if the scheme name contains 'elss' or 'tax'), a lock-in period of 3 years (1095 days) is enforced:
      - Lots with holding period less than 1095 days are flagged as "locked". Their cost and profit are accumulated 
        separately (locked_in_amount, locked_in_profit) and are not included in LT gain calculations.
      - Only unlocked lots contribute to LTCG eligibility.
